## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used through stateless, single-session interactions optimized for immediate task completion. This paper presents CHIMERA, an "operating system-level" prompt protocol that enables long-term, co-evolutionary partnership between a human user and an AI system. Over six months of iterative development, CHIMERA evolved from a simple 7-item dialogue logging template (200 words) into a comprehensive system comprising 11 operational modules, 6 axiomatic laws, and self-governance mechanisms (11,500 words). This evolution was driven by systematic documentation of failures, extraction of reusable principles, and structured amendment processesâ€”embodying what the protocol itself terms "intellectual compounding."

## Overview

CHIMERA is not merely a set of instructions, but a persistent, evolving constitution designed to govern long-term collaboration between a human user and an AI system. This protocol is provided as an open resource for researchers and practitioners exploring the future of human-AI symbiosis.

Key architectural features include:
- **6 Axiomatic Laws:** The immutable philosophical foundation of the system.
- **11 Operational Modules:** Concrete subroutines for tactical execution (e.g., Structured Creativity, External Audit).
- **A Meta-Governance Layer:** Self-regulatory mechanisms to manage the protocol's own evolution and prevent complexity bloat.
